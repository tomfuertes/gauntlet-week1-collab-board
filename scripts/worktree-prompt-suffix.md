After implementation, invoke the Skill tool with skill="pr-review-toolkit:review-pr" (do NOT use Task tool for this - it is a Skill, not a subagent) and fix all issues before starting UAT. After UAT passes, commit all changes to the feature branch. Do not open a PR. Use `npm run dev` for the dev server (builds once + serves, ports auto-loaded from worktree.ports). After starting the dev server, use `npm run health` to wait for it (polls every 500ms, auto-detects port) - never use sleep to wait for servers. Use scripts/localcurl.sh instead of curl for API testing. After committing, invoke the Skill tool with skill="recap" to analyze the session and extract learnings, then invoke the Skill tool with skill="last-call" to dump those learnings to disk. Finally, invoke the Skill tool with skill="commit" to commit the last-call artifacts.

**Session notes:** Write all session notes (decisions made, what shipped, loose ends found) to `docs/sessions/<branch>.md` where `<branch>` is the worktree branch name (e.g., `docs/sessions/feat-frames.md`). Do NOT edit `docs/notes.md` - the orchestrator consolidates session files at merge time. For non-obvious decisions, also add `// KEY-DECISION <YYYY-MM-DD>: <rationale>` as a code comment at the exact location.
