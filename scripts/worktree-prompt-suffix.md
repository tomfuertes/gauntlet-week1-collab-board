After implementation, invoke the Skill tool with skill="pr-review-toolkit:review-pr" (do NOT use Task tool for this - it is a Skill, not a subagent) and fix all issues before starting UAT. After UAT passes, commit all changes to the feature branch. Do not open a PR. Use npm run dev for the dev server (ports auto-loaded from worktree.ports). After starting the dev server, use npm run health to wait for it (polls every 500ms, auto-detects port) - never use sleep to wait for servers. Use scripts/localcurl.sh instead of curl for API testing. After committing, invoke the Skill tool with skill="last-call" to generate an end-of-session summary.
