After implementation, run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint`. For multi-file or behavioral changes, invoke the Skill tool with skill="pr-review-toolkit:review-pr" and fix all issues before UAT. For single-file lightweight changes, skip PR review and UAT - trust the types. Commit all changes to the feature branch. Do not open a PR. Use `npm run dev` for the dev server only if UAT is needed (builds once + serves, ports auto-loaded from worktree.ports). After starting the dev server, use `npm run health` to wait for it (polls every 500ms, auto-detects port). Use scripts/localcurl.sh instead of curl for API testing.

**No session notes files.** Do NOT create docs/sessions/<branch>.md or edit docs/notes.md. Task list + git log is the source of truth. For non-obvious decisions, add `// KEY-DECISION <YYYY-MM-DD>: <rationale>` as a code comment at the exact location.
