## What WebSearch Found That Claude Couldn't Hallucinate

These are specific facts with dates and sources that required live web data and were not in Claude's training data (cutoff: May 2025):

### Genuinely Novel Intelligence

1. **Miro MCP Server (Feb 2, 2026):** Launched 16 days ago. Connects to 11 AI coding platforms including Claude Code. Built with Anthropic, AWS, GitHub, Google. This is extremely recent and directly relevant to YesAInd's competitive positioning.

2. **Figma x Anthropic "Code to Canvas" (Feb 17, 2026):** Announced YESTERDAY. Claude Code users can send rendered UI to Figma as editable layers. Runs on Figma MCP Server. Uses Claude Sonnet 4.6. This is breaking news.

3. **Figma IPO and subsequent 85% stock crash:** IPO July 31, 2025 at $18.8B valuation, day-one pop to $58B, then crashed 85% from peak. The "software reckoning" narrative. All post-training-cutoff.

4. **Figma Make GA (2026):** Prompt-to-prototype with chat-based refinement, embeddable in FigJam. Post-cutoff.

5. **Miro AI Workflows GA (Jan 2026):** Enterprise launch with multi-vendor AI integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Glean, Amazon Q). Post-cutoff.

6. **Miro AI Canvas beta with free Sidekicks/Flows (Oct 2025):** Canvas 25 event details, the "free during beta" pricing, 80+ templates with built-in AI. Post-cutoff.

7. **tldraw SDK 4.0 (Sept 2025):** The Agent starter kit (Cursor-style chatbot), $6K/yr commercial license, 100-day trial. Post-cutoff.

8. **Figma ChatGPT integration via OpenAI Apps SDK (Oct 6, 2025):** The specific mechanism (MCP + Apps SDK), stock impact (+7%), diagram types supported. Post-cutoff.

9. **Miro growth metrics:** 100M+ users, 40% AI feature adoption, $500M ARR estimate. Some post-cutoff.

10. **Dylan Field's "MS-DOS era of AI" framing and multiplayer philosophy:** Recent interviews with specific strategic language. Post-cutoff.

### What Claude Already Knew (pre-cutoff, May 2025)

- Miro Sidekicks concept (announced but not launched pre-cutoff)
- FigJam AI basics (sticky sorting, summarization, Jambot)
- tldraw Make Real (GPT-4V sketch-to-code)
- tldraw "computer" project concept
- tldraw Series A ($10M, April 2025 - right at cutoff boundary)
- General competitive positioning of all three companies

## What Decision This Changed (or Didn't)

### Sprint Priority Assessment with New Intel

**Original 5 sprint proposals:**
1. AI Cursor Presence (ghost cursor showing AI intent)
2. Contextual AI Actions (selection-gated toolbar)
3. AI Batch Undo (undo all AI changes in one action)
4. Intent Preview (preview AI changes before applying)
5. AI Board Generation (full board from prompt)

### Impact of New Competitive Intelligence

**The biggest strategic signal is MCP/tool integration, not on-canvas AI.**

Both Miro (Feb 2) and Figma (Feb 17) just launched MCP servers - making their canvases accessible to external AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.). This is a fundamentally different approach than YesAInd's embedded AI chat. The industry is moving toward "canvas as context layer for the AI coding ecosystem" rather than "AI as a feature inside the canvas."

**Specific impacts on sprint priorities:**

1. **AI Board Generation (was #5) should move UP.** Figma Make (prompt-to-prototype) is now GA. Miro Flows do multi-step generation. Both competitors have full-board generation as a shipped, polished feature. YesAInd's template chips (SWOT, Kanban) are primitive by comparison. This is now table stakes, not a differentiator.

2. **Contextual AI Actions (was #2) - VALIDATED but reframe.** Miro Sidekicks "see anything you select on the canvas and use that context." YesAInd's selection-aware AI is on the right track but the bar has risen - Sidekicks offer persistent, customizable agents, not just one-shot actions.

3. **Intent Preview (was #4) - DIFFERENTIATION OPPORTUNITY.** Neither Miro nor Figma offer explicit intent preview for AI actions. Miro Flows show intermediate steps but that's workflow transparency, not pre-commit preview. This is a genuine gap in the market.

4. **AI Cursor Presence (was #1) - LOWER PRIORITY than expected.** Neither Miro nor Figma has shipped visible AI cursor presence. This may indicate the feature is harder to get right than expected, or that users don't actually want it. The industry is moving toward agent autonomy (Flows, Sidekicks) rather than agent visibility.

5. **AI Batch Undo (was #3) - STILL IMPORTANT, STILL DIFFERENTIATION.** No competitor has shipped explicit AI undo. As AI generates more content (Miro Flows, Figma Make), the undo problem becomes more acute. This is a quality-of-life feature that competitors will eventually need.

### Revised Priority Recommendation

| Priority | Sprint | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | AI Board Generation | Table stakes - Figma Make and Miro Flows already ship this |
| 2 | Contextual AI Actions | Validated by Miro Sidekicks; raise the bar on selection-aware AI |
| 3 | Intent Preview | Genuine market gap - neither Miro nor Figma offers this |
| 4 | AI Batch Undo | Quality differentiator, increasingly important as AI generates more |
| 5 | AI Cursor Presence | No market signal this is desired; deprioritize |

### One Decision This Changed

**AI Board Generation should be sprint 1, not sprint 5.** The competitive intel shows that full-board generation from prompts is now a shipped feature at both Miro and Figma, not a future aspiration. YesAInd's current template chips (SWOT, Kanban via chat) are 2 generations behind. Without this, YesAInd looks like a toy at first interaction.

### One Decision This Didn't Change

**The embedded AI chat sidebar approach is still valid.** While Miro and Figma are adding MCP for external agents, they're also investing heavily in on-canvas AI (Sidekicks, Flows, Make). The chat-based interface with tools is the right architecture - it just needs to be more capable.

### New Strategic Concern: MCP

The Miro and Figma MCP server launches (both in the last 3 weeks) signal a new competitive dimension YesAInd hasn't considered: being a "context source" for external AI agents. This is a future concern, not an immediate sprint priority, but worth tracking. If Claude Code and Cursor users expect to pull/push to their whiteboard via MCP, YesAInd will need an MCP server eventually.

---

## Scores

- **Actionability: 4/5** - The competitive intel directly changed the recommended sprint order. AI Board Generation moved from last to first priority based on concrete evidence that Figma Make and Miro Flows have shipped full-board generation as GA features. The Figma x Anthropic "Code to Canvas" announcement (literally yesterday) and Miro's MCP server (16 days ago) surface a new competitive dimension (MCP integration) that wasn't on YesAInd's radar. The only reason this isn't a 5 is that YesAInd is a Gauntlet exercise, not a real product competing for market share - so "competitive urgency" is somewhat artificial.

- **Novelty vs vanilla Claude: 4/5** - Approximately 70% of the substantive findings required WebSearch. The Miro MCP server (Feb 2), Figma x Anthropic Code to Canvas (Feb 17), Figma Make GA, Miro AI Workflows GA (Jan 2026), tldraw SDK 4.0 licensing ($6K/yr), Figma's IPO and 85% stock crash, Dylan Field's "software reckoning" CNBC interview, and specific growth metrics (Miro 100M users, 40% AI adoption) were all post-training-cutoff. Claude's training data knew about Miro Sidekicks as a concept, FigJam AI basics, and tldraw Make Real - but the shipped reality (Sidekicks are free in beta, Flows are multi-step workflow engines, Figma partnered with Anthropic specifically) required live data. The reason this isn't a 5 is that the strategic conclusions (AI board generation is table stakes, selection-aware AI is the right direction) could have been reached from training data alone - the web search provided the concrete evidence and urgency, not the directional insight.

## Appendix: Skill Methodology Assessment

### What the 9-step framework added

The company-research skill's structured steps forced thoroughness. Without the framework, a competitive analysis might stop at "what are their AI features" and miss:
- Executive quotes revealing strategic framing ("MS-DOS era of AI", "canvas is the best surface")
- PLG signals (Miro's free-during-beta strategy, AI credits as enterprise upsell)
- Roadmap signals from MCP/partnership announcements

### What the framework missed

The skill is designed for researching a single company you might work at or sell to. Applying it to competitive analysis required adaptation:
- Steps 5-6 (org impact, PM career paths) were irrelevant and correctly skipped
- The framework doesn't explicitly call for pricing/packaging analysis, which turned out to be highly relevant (Miro's AI credit model, tldraw's $6K license)
- No step for "what does this mean for MY product" - the synthesis step (9) is about the researched company, not about competitive response

### Bottom line

The skill provided useful scaffolding for a competitive research task, but the real value came from WebSearch finding post-cutoff intelligence. The framework's contribution was ensuring breadth (exec quotes, product details, roadmap, PLG) rather than depth. A senior PM would have naturally covered these dimensions without the skill template. The skill's value is higher for junior PMs who might not know what to look for.
